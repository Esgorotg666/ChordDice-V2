Core harmonic ingredients

Modes: natural minor (Aeolian), harmonic minor, Phrygian, Phrygian dominant, Dorian, Locrian for unstable color.
Intervals: minor seconds, tritones, minor thirds, and perfect fifths; stacked 4ths and open fifths (no third) for ambiguous tonality.
Pedals/drone notes: sustained root or drone octave under changing chords to create hypnotic tension.
Dissonance: b5 (tritone), b2, b6 are used deliberately; diminished and augmented sonorities appear as passing or focal elements.
Tremolo textures: arpeggiated tremolo of chord shapes (often diads or triads) makes the progression feel continuous rather than chordal.
Common progression types and examples (written as root movement)

Static modal vamp (most common)
- i — i — i — i (Aeolian/Phrygian with melodic variation over same chord)
- Example effect: sustained gloom, allows lead melody/atmosphere to evolve.
Pedal + modal movement
- i (pedal on tonic) moving upper voices: i — i(♭2) — i(♭6) — i
- Use: keeps tonal center while introducing modal color.
Stepwise modal descent/ascent
- i — VII — VI — VII (Aeolian): e.g., Am — G — F — G
- i — bII — i — bII (Phrygian oscillation): e.g., Em — F — Em — F
- Effect: ritualistic, chant-like movement.
Minor/Phrygian with tritone shifts
- i — b5/i+ (root stays, chord quality shifts by augmented fourth)
- Example: Em — E♭°/E chordal color; use dissonant passing chord sparingly.
Power-chord fifths with suspended motion
- i5 — iv5 — V5 — i5 (fifth-chords, no third)
- Creates open, primitive sound; add minor second harmonic squeal on top for tension.
Chromatic mediant and distant root shifts
- i — ♭VI — ♭III — ♭VII (Aeolian/chromatic mediants)
- Example: Am — F — C — G (used slower for epic sections).
Diminished/pedal modulation device
- i — dim(i+2) — i — VI (diminished as bridge to shift mood)
- Diminished chords serve as tension-release pivots for modal shifts.
Alternating diad or two-chord patterns
- i ↔ iv or i ↔ VII (call-and-response, very common)
- Example: Em ↔ C (Em — C — Em — C), often in blast/fast tremolo contexts.
Suspended/add2/add9 coloring
- i(add9) — iv(add11) — i — v(add9)
- Adds cold, chorale-like color while preserving minor center.
Rhythmic and arranging considerations

Tremolo-picked eighths/sixteenths make harmonic rhythm feel continuous; change chords every 2–8 bars rather than every bar.
Use long-held cinematic chords for ambient/atmospheric passages; sparse progression supports choir/pad layers.
Layering: keep a low distorted guitar emphasizing root/octave, second guitar arpeggiates triads or runs melody lines; synth pads double modal notes for weight.
Dynamics: black metal relies on contrast—use minimalism and sudden expansion (one new chord or instrument creates large perceived progression).
