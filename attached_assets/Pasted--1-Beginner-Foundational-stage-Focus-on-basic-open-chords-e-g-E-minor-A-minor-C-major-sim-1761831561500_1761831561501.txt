1.  Beginner: Foundational stage. Focus on basic open chords (e.g., E minor, A minor, C major), simple strumming patterns, reading tablature or basic notation, and tuning the instrument. Goals include playing simple songs (e.g., folk tunes) without buzzing strings; theory is minimal (e.g., understanding frets and strings).
2.  Novice: Early consolidation. Builds on basics with power chords, basic barre chords (e.g., F major), alternate picking, simple scales (e.g., minor pentatonic in one position), and fingerstyle patterns. Can play full songs with chord progressions; introduces music theory like key signatures and basic rhythm reading.
3.  Intermediate: Expanding versatility. Incorporates full barre chord shapes across the fretboard, modes (e.g., Dorian, Mixolydian), arpeggios, hybrid picking, bending/vibrato techniques, and genre-specific styles (e.g., blues shuffle or basic fingerpicking). Repertoire includes intermediate pieces (e.g., “Stairway to Heaven” solo intro); theory covers chord construction, intervals, and transposition.
4.  Advanced: Technical and musical refinement. Mastery of complex techniques like sweep picking, economy picking, tapping, advanced fingerstyle (e.g., Travis picking), modal interchange, and odd time signatures. Can improvise fluently over changes, arrange pieces, and perform in ensembles; deep theory knowledge (e.g., functional harmony, voice leading) enables composition.
5.  Expert: Professional-level execution. Virtuosic command of all techniques, seamless genre blending (e.g., fusion, classical, jazz), recording/production skills, and pedagogical ability. Repertoire spans originals and standards at concert level; theory application is intuitive for real-time analysis and innovation.
6.  Master: Pinnacle of artistry. Transcendent musicianship with innovative contributions (e.g., new techniques or influential albums), effortless adaptation to any context, and profound expressiveness. Icons like Andrés Segovia (classical), Jimi Hendrix (rock), or Paco de Lucía (flamenco) exemplify this; involves legacy-building through teaching, recording, or performance that shapes the instrument’s evolution.
