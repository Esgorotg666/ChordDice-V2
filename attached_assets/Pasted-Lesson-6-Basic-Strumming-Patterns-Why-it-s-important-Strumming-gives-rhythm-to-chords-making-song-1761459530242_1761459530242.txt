Lesson 6: Basic Strumming Patterns
Why it’s important: Strumming gives rhythm to chords, making songs recognizable. Learning patterns builds timing and right-hand coordination, essential for playing with others or along with music.
How to practice it:
1.  Use a simple pattern: Down, Down, Up, Up, Down (D D U U D).
2.  Hold an E minor chord, strum with a pick or thumb, keeping your wrist loose.
3.  Count aloud: “1, 2, 3-and, 4-and, 5” to match the pattern (D on 1, D on 2, U on 3, U on 4, D on 5).
4.  Practice on Em for 5 minutes, then switch to G and C, 5 minutes each.
5.  Use a metronome at 60 BPM to keep steady. Increase speed gradually.
6.  Practice 15 minutes daily, ensuring even strums. Check in a mirror for smooth wrist motion.
Visual Aid: Watch your right hand in a mirror: the wrist should move like a hinge, not the whole arm. No fretboard diagram needed.
Practice Duration: 15 minutes daily for 2 weeks.

Lesson 7: Chord Transitions
Why it’s important: Smooth chord changes make songs flow naturally. This builds muscle memory and finger independence, preventing pauses that disrupt rhythm.
How to practice it:
1.  Use Em, G, and C from Lesson 5.
2.  Practice switching: Em to G, G to C, C to Em, 10 times each, strumming once per chord.
3.  Move fingers together when possible (e.g., for Em to G, shift index and middle as a unit).
4.  Start slow, taking 10-15 seconds per switch. Aim to reduce to 2-3 seconds over 2 weeks.
5.  Practice 15 minutes daily, using a metronome at 60 BPM for timing.
Fretboard Diagrams: Refer to Lesson 5 diagrams for Em, G, C.
Visual Aid: In a mirror, watch your left hand: fingers should lift off and land together, not one at a time. Ensure the guitar stays stable.
Practice Duration: 15 minutes daily for 2-3 weeks.

Lesson 8: Reading Chord Charts
Why it’s important: Chord charts are common in songbooks and online tabs, letting you learn songs quickly. Understanding them builds independence in finding and playing new music.
How to practice it:
1.  Find a chord chart online (e.g., search “E minor chord chart”).
2.  Note the layout: Vertical lines are strings (low E on left), horizontal lines are frets, dots show finger positions, numbers indicate fingers (1=index, 2=middle, etc.).
3.  Practice reading Em, G, C charts, placing fingers as shown.
4.  Strum each chord 5 times, checking against the chart for accuracy.
5.  Practice 10 minutes daily, adding D major and A minor charts after a week (search online for diagrams).
6.  Use a mirror to confirm finger placement matches the chart.
Fretboard Diagrams: Use Lesson 5 diagrams for Em, G, C. For new chords:
