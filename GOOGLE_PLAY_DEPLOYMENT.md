# 🚀 Deploy to Google Play Store

Your Chord Riff Generator is now ready for Google Play Store with **automatic deployment**! Here's the complete process:

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Google Play Developer Account** - $25 one-time registration fee
   - Sign up at: https://play.google.com/console/
   - Complete identity verification and payment

2. **Android Keystore** (for app signing) - **REQUIRED**
   - You need to create a keystore file for signing your app

3. **Google Cloud Service Account** - **NEW: For Automatic Deployment**
   - Required for automatic uploads to Google Play Store
   - Follow setup in "🤖 Automatic Deployment Setup" section

## 🔄 Enhanced Build & Deploy Process (GitHub Actions)

Every time you push code to GitHub, your app will automatically:
- ✅ Build the React web app
- ✅ Generate signed Android APK (for testing)
- ✅ Generate signed Android App Bundle (AAB for Google Play)
- ✅ Verify both APK and AAB are properly signed
- ✅ **NEW**: Automatically upload to Google Play Store Internal Testing
- ✅ Make files available for download as backup

## 🤖 Automatic Deployment Setup (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Google Cloud Service Account Setup

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create new project or select existing one
   - Enable "Google Play Android Developer API"

2. **Create Service Account**
   - Go to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Name: `play-store-deploy`
   - Download JSON key file (keep secure!)

3. **Add Service Account to Play Console**
   - Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
   - Users and permissions → Invite new users
   - Add service account email from JSON
   - Grant permissions: Manage releases, View app info

### Step 2: GitHub Secrets Setup
Add to your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

KEYSTORE_PASSWORD - Your keystore password  
KEY_ALIAS - Your keystore alias
KEY_PASSWORD - Your key password
```

**Critical**: Use `KEYSTORE_BASE64` (not `KEYSTORE_B64`) as the secret name.

### Step 3: First Manual Upload (Required)
**Important**: Upload one release manually first to create app entry:
1. Create app in Google Play Console
2. Upload AAB to Internal Testing
3. This enables automatic uploads for future releases

## 📱 Publishing Steps

### Option A: Automatic (After Setup Above)
- ✅ **Create version tag** (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`)
- ✅ **Or use manual workflow** (Actions → Run workflow → Enable deployment)
- ✅ GitHub Actions automatically uploads to Internal Testing
- ✅ Check Google Play Console to promote through tracks
- ✅ Internal → Alpha → Beta → Production

### Option B: Manual (Backup Method)

### 1. Get Your Built App
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Click "Actions" tab
- Click the latest successful build
- Download the **AAB file** (not APK) from artifacts

### 2. Upload to Google Play Console

- Click "Create app"
- Choose:
  - **App name**: "Chord Riff Generator"

### 6. Review & Publish
- Review all sections for completeness
- Submit for review (usually takes 1-3 days)
- Once approved, your app goes live!

## 🔐 Keystore Setup (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

Before your app can build for Google Play, you MUST create an Android keystore:

### Step 1: Create Keystore
Run this command on your computer (requires Java):
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore chordriff-release.keystore -alias chordriff -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

When prompted, enter:
- **Store password**: Create a strong password (save this!)
- **Key password**: Same as store password (or different - save this!)
- **Name details**: Your name/company info

### Step 2: Add to GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Your keystore file encoded as base64
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Your keystore password
   - `KEY_ALIAS`: `chordriff` (or whatever alias you used)
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`: Your key password

### Step 3: Encode Keystore as Base64
Run this command (replace with your actual keystore path):
```bash
base64 -i chordriff-release.keystore | tr -d '\n'
```
Copy the output and paste it as `KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Keep your keystore file safe! If you lose it, you can never update your app on Google Play.

## 🔄 Future Updates

### With Automatic Deployment (Recommended):
1. Make changes in Replit
2. **Create version tag**: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`
3. ✅ **Done!** - App automatically uploads to Internal Testing
4. **Promote** through tracks in Google Play Console (Internal → Alpha → Beta → Production)

### Alternative: Manual Workflow Trigger
1. Go to GitHub → Actions → "Build and Deploy Android App"
2. Click "Run workflow" → Enable "Deploy to Google Play Store"

## 📊 Track Management Strategy

### Deployment Tracks:
1. **Internal Testing** (Automatic) - Small team, up to 100 testers
2. **Alpha** (Manual promote) - Closed testing, larger group
