## üîê Keystore Setup (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

Before your app can build for Google Play, you MUST create an Android keystore:

### Step 1: Create Keystore
Run this command on your computer (requires Java):
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore chordriff-release.keystore -alias chordriff -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

When prompted, enter:
- **Store password**: Create a strong password (save this!)
- **Key password**: Same as store password (or different - save this!)
- **Name details**: Your name/company info

### Step 2: Add to GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Your keystore file encoded as base64
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Your keystore password
   - `KEY_ALIAS`: `chordriff` (or whatever alias you used)
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`: Your key password

### Step 3: Encode Keystore as Base64
Run this command (replace with your actual keystore path):
```bash
base64 -i chordriff-release.keystore | tr -d '\n'
```
Copy the output and paste it as `KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Keep your keystore file safe! If you lose it, you can never update your app on Google Play.
